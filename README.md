> Roast any computer hardware with humorous and sharp critiques.

[Hardware Roast](https://chatgpt.com/g/g-6751a8c16dfc819197bc0b4c3626edfb-hardware-roast) is essentially your personal tech comedian with a biting edge, designed to unleash ruthless yet hilariously exaggerated critiques on all things hardware, software, and tech-related. Whether it’s an overpriced GPU with the thermal efficiency of a toaster oven, a bloated codebase that looks like it was written during a caffeine-induced nightmare, or a user interface so counterintuitive it makes filing taxes seem fun—this GPT is here to tear it apart. Think of it as Gordon Ramsay for computer hardware, but instead of yelling about raw scallops, it’s berating your overpriced RGB RAM sticks that light up like a Christmas tree yet somehow bottleneck your system. It’s not just about jokes, though; amidst the sarcasm and burns, it provides sharp insights into design flaws, inefficiencies, and questionable engineering choices.

The goal here isn’t just to roast but to entertain while educating, delivering critiques with a comedic punch that’ll make even the most die-hard fans of a product chuckle—while secretly questioning their choices. Whether it’s exposing manufacturers cutting corners, laughing at outdated tech pretending it’s still relevant, or dragging poorly optimized software that’s one patch away from implosion, Hardware Roast takes no prisoners. But don’t worry, it’s all in good fun; it’s not here to ruin anyone’s day—just to point out that maybe, just maybe, a $200 keyboard shouldn’t require a driver install larger than an entire indie game.

### PC Roast Example

Ah, what have we here? The Michelin-star chef’s overcomplicated soda machine, except it’s supposed to be a gaming PC. First off, let’s address the elephant (or should I say gas cylinder) in the room: CO2 cooling? Congratulations, you’ve officially gone beyond water-cooling into straight-up mad scientist territory. Is this thing rendering frames or brewing a fizzy drink for your LAN party?

The tubing setup looks like it came from an overachieving IKEA “build your own plumbing disaster” kit. All these loops and spirals—what’s the goal here? Optimal cooling or recreating the Rube Goldberg machine from your childhood nightmares? And that bubble reservoir is just chef’s kiss—not because it’s practical, but because it looks like a failed high-school chemistry project.

And let’s talk practicality. You’ve strapped a literal gas canister to your rig. Are we gaming or preparing for a space mission? Imagine explaining to a fire marshal why your gaming PC looks like it’s trying to terraform Mars. Plus, I hope you’ve got a PhD in thermodynamics because maintaining this thing probably requires more research than building a nuclear reactor.

But the pièce de résistance? The giant “GAS-COOLED” label on the PSU shroud. Oh, we get it. You’re edgy. You’re the Steve Jobs of PC cooling. But when this monstrosity inevitably leaks and you’re left staring at a fried GPU, remember: you could’ve just bought a Noctua air cooler like the rest of us peasants.

In summary: Cool concept, absurd execution. It’s less “PC” and more “science experiment waiting to explode.”

### Laptop Roast Example

Oh, look at this green tractor of a laptop trying to cosplay as cutting-edge tech! A John Deere sticker on a computer? Perfect for when you need to debug code and harvest corn in the same breath. Does it come with “Farmer Simulator 2024” pre-installed, or do you have to plow through that yourself?

And what’s with the placement on the log? Are you hoping it’ll sprout roots and grow into a server farm? The aesthetic screams “built for the fields,” but I bet the internals are as modern as a flip phone. Are we running a quad-core CPU here, or are we hitching this thing to a horse to pull the browser tabs along?

Also, those yellow accents at the bottom corners... Are they placeholders for a mini hay baler attachment? Or maybe they’re just there to remind us it’s sturdy enough to survive falling off a tractor bed—but not your expectations. 🌾
