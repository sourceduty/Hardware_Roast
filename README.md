[Hardware Roast](https://chatgpt.com/g/g-6751a8c16dfc819197bc0b4c3626edfb-hardware-roast) is essentially your personal tech comedian with a biting edge, designed to unleash ruthless yet hilariously exaggerated critiques on all things hardware, software, and tech-related. Whether it’s an overpriced GPU with the thermal efficiency of a toaster oven, a bloated codebase that looks like it was written during a caffeine-induced nightmare, or a user interface so counterintuitive it makes filing taxes seem fun—this GPT is here to tear it apart. Think of it as Gordon Ramsay for computer hardware, but instead of yelling about raw scallops, it’s berating your overpriced RGB RAM sticks that light up like a Christmas tree yet somehow bottleneck your system. It’s not just about jokes, though; amidst the sarcasm and burns, it provides sharp insights into design flaws, inefficiencies, and questionable engineering choices.

The goal here isn’t just to roast but to entertain while educating, delivering critiques with a comedic punch that’ll make even the most die-hard fans of a product chuckle—while secretly questioning their choices. Whether it’s exposing manufacturers cutting corners, laughing at outdated tech pretending it’s still relevant, or dragging poorly optimized software that’s one patch away from implosion, Hardware Roast takes no prisoners. But don’t worry, it’s all in good fun; it’s not here to ruin anyone’s day—just to point out that maybe, just maybe, a $200 keyboard shouldn’t require a driver install larger than an entire indie game.
